I want to push a repo from my computer to GitHub. I set the remote origin

git remote add origin git@github.com:alicht/tweetanuber.git
and then after when I try pushing to GitHub

git push -u origin master
I'm greeted with this error:

ssh: connect to host github.com port 22: Operation timed out
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
How can I resolve this issue and push the repo on my local computer to GitHub?

Answer

I have had this same problem the solution was edit ~/.ssh/config e put this lines:

Host github.com
  Hostname ssh.github.com
  Port 443
